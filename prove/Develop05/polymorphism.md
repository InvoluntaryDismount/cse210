Polymorphism is the use of different versions of code for the same function to fit our needs. In programming there are many instances where we want to find some end result like the area of a shape. Different shapes have different formulas for calculating areas. We can use polymorphism to have different code for the function that finds the area for each different kind of shape. We did exactly this with the Learning05 prepare activity.  Within our base class we had an abstract function for getting area. Within the derived classes we overwrote that abstract function to give ecah derived class its own version of that get area function. Because we used polymorphism, we did not need to create different functions for each derived class. We could just change how the same function worked for each class. This helps keep our code simpler and helps us better follow the principle of encapsulation.
