Inheritance is the principle of having one class gain attributes and methods from a class it is derived from. The class it is derived from is the parent, or base, class, and the class that is inheriting from the parent class is known as the child, or derived, class. Inheritance is helpful if we are creating multiple classes that have similar variables or methods. These similar methods can be created in one parent class and can be inherited by the child classes. This saves time and code because we do not need to retype the common lines for each individual class. Inheritance can be used in situations like this week's prove assignment "Mindfulness Program". We created multiple different activity classes that all had similar attributes like name, description, and duration, as well as similar methods like for getting the duration from the user and a method that displayed a loading icon in the console. Instead of writing out the attributes and methods for each separate activity class, I created one parent class "Activity" that all the activities could derive from. I did this by defining my class and specifying that it was derived from the "Activity" class with a colon and the parent class name. In code it looked like this: "class Listening : Activity {}".
