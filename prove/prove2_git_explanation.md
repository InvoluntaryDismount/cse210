## Version Control
Version control is the implementation of a system that the tracks changes made on a project that typically involves coding. This system allows individuals to work on the project on their own local clone of the project then sync changes made to the main project repository. This system allows work to be done independent of others working on the project. Another advantage to version control is the ability to track changes made and revert to previous versions if something goes wrong with a current version. One example of a git command is "git add .". This command stages every change that has been made on the local machine. From here, the staged changes can be committed and pushed through other commands.
