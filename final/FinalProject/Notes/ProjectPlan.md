# Macro Tracker
### Blake Christesen

## Objective
I will be doing the open ended final project. The goal is to make a simple program that tracks daily macro intake (protein, fats, carbs) as well as caloric intake. The program will record the daily intakes and keep a record that can be accessed by the user. The user will have the option to ask the program what their recommended daily intake is for each macro and the program will return a value based off the user's answer to health related questions. The user will also have the option to view weekly summaries.
